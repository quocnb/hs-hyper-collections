summary: "<div>\r\n<p>Java developers often face the need to store and process data\
  \ conveniently. The <strong>Java Collections Framework</strong> can help with this\
  \ issue, as developers usually don't need to create new collections from scratch\
  \ â€“ they only need to apply or slightly extend the existing ones to solve their\
  \ needs.<br>\r\nHowever, there are some design drawbacks inherited in the Java Collections\
  \ Framework, which can even lead to bugs in your programs. Some approaches used\
  \ in this library are considered obsolete now and are normally avoided in modern\
  \ libraries.<br>\r\nBesides, sometimes developers face rare issues, for which the\
  \ standard collections aren't enough. In such cases, alternative libraries such\
  \ as <strong>Google Guava Collections</strong> or <strong>Apache Common Collections</strong>\
  \ may help. These libraries contain more collections and an abundance of auxiliary\
  \ algorithms to work with. Another solution is to write your problem-specific collections.\
  \ This is much more complicated and not always the best solution, but it isn't forbidden\
  \ either.</p>\r\n</div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/319?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
